# Cinemix 
Cinemix is a django based webapp using omdb python wrapper on the ODMb Api. The app takes any movie request and displays results in a friendly UI, details of relevant movies such as plot,
genre, runtime, release date, etc are presented to the user as well as a link to the movie's trailer.

### Challenge: https://www.mindsumo.com/Movies
## Capital One SES Challenge:
Movies can have a tremendous impact on both individuals as well as the broader society. We all have our favorite characters, quotes, and plotlines, and the constant release of 
new movies gives us a steady diet of new media to consume either on the big screen or from the comfort of our own homes. 
The vast number of movies in existence can make it difficult to recall movie details like release date, director, awards, etc. For this challenge, we want you to create a webapp 
that can surface movie information using an open database API.
